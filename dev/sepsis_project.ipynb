    "Early detection of sepsis is essential for patients to receive timely treatment and improve their chances of survival. Fortunately, machine learning technology can help medical professionals identify sepsis quickly and accurately. By using an ML API for sepsis detection, healthcare providers can analyze a patient's medical data and receive real-time notifications when symptoms of sepsis are present.\n",
